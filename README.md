Welcome to the introductory paper for Scriptrr.

Scriptrr is an open source programming language created by the developers at Kor Labs and released under a Creative Commons License.

Scriptrr was created with simplicity in mind, and has a basic syntax, yet can accomplish many advanced tasks.

Scriptrr is an universal language, allowing it to be used on any platform availible.

Scriptrr is a development language for web and native development. To use it for these different platforms, an interperter must be created for the respective platform.

A basic interperter will be provided by Kor Labs for users to use to start, however it will be very basic and hopefully the open source community will build upon it and add more features.
